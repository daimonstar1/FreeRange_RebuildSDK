    certain software that may be accessible or downloaded from the Services. In the
    event that you access or download software from the Services, the software, including
    any files, images incorporated in or generated by the software, and data accompanying
    the software (collectively, the \"Software\") are licensed to you by GAME TACO
    or a GAME TACO-approved third party software provider (\"Third Party Provider\").
    GAME TACO does not transfer title to the Software to you. You own the medium on
    which the Software is recorded, but GAME TACO retains full and complete title
    to its Software, and all intellectual property rights therein. For purposes of
    these TOS, such Software shall be deemed included in the definition of \"Services
    Materials\". Furthermore, your use of any Software of a Third Party Provider shall
    be subject to the end user license agreement or any other terms of use set forth
    by such Third Party Provider for its Software.\n\nIf you wish to participate in
    Tournaments or receive Services, you may be required to first download certain
    proprietary Game Taco software and/or Apps (together with the content included
    therein, any associated documentation, and any application program interfaces,
    license keys, and patches, updates, upgrades, improvements, enhancements, fixes
    and revised versions of any of the foregoing, is collectively \"Software\"). If
    you do not download the Software, you will not be able to participate in Tournaments
    or receive relevant Services. Sometimes you will download the Software directly
    from us, and sometimes you will download Software from a third party, such as
    a game developer, but in either case your use of the Software is subject to these
    Terms.\n\nWe may choose to offer technical support for Software from time to time
    in our discretion. Such technical support may require that we remotely access
    your personal computer or device on which the Software is installed (\"Device\").
    Also, if and when we update the Software or deploy patches, updates, and modifications
    to the Software, we may do so through remote access of your Device without your
    knowledge. You hereby consent to these activities. You acknowledge that if we
    cannot remotely access your Device, then the Software may no longer work, and
    this may prevent you from participating in Tournaments or otherwise receiving
    Services. Our access to your Device will be limited only for purposes of providing
    support or updating the Software, and is governed by the terms of our Privacy
    Policy.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>2.3 - Submissions</color></size></b>\n\nGAME
    TACO is pleased to hear from its Users and welcomes your comments regarding GAME
    TACO's Services and products. Nevertheless, GAME TACO's company policy does not
    allow it to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other
    than those it has specifically requested (see below). While we value your feedback
    of our Services and products, we request that you be specific in your comments
    of those Services and products, and that you not submit any creative ideas, suggestions,
    or materials. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy
    to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by
    GAME TACO's or its affiliates' professional staff might seem to others to be similar
    to their own creative work. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any original
    creative materials such as game concepts/treatments, stories or character ideas,
    screenplays, or original artwork. \n\nIf you send or post certain specific submissions
    at our request (e.g., via message boards or in connection with contests) or if
    you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or any other
    information (each, a \"Submission\" and collectively, the \"Submissions\") despite
    our request that you not send us any unsolicited Submissions or other creative
    materials, the Submission will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary
    in each instance. For purposes of this Paragraph 2.3, all Community Content shall
    be deemed included in the definition of Submissions. None of the Submissions shall
    be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on the part of GAME TACO, and
    GAME TACO shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Any
    Submission may be used by GAME TACO without restriction for any purpose whatsoever,
    including, without limitation, reproduction, disclosure, transmission, publication,
    broadcast or posting, and you hereby irrevocably waive, release and give up any
    claim that any use of such Submission violates any of your rights, including,
    without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, moral rights, privacy rights, proprietary
    or other property rights, publicity rights, or right to credit for the material
    or ideas. GAME TACO shall have and is irrevocably granted the right, but not the
    obligation, to reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, broadcast, license, perform,
    post, sell, translate, incorporate, create derivative works from, distribute and
    otherwise use the Submission in any and all media, now known or hereafter devised,
    throughout the universe, in perpetuity, without according you any compensation
    or credit. By submitting a Submission to the Services or GAME TACO, you represent
    that such Submission is original with you and does not violate or infringe upon
    the rights of any third parties, including, without limitation, any intellectual
    property rights and rights of publicity and/or privacy. All Submissions to the
    Services and/or GAME TACO shall be the sole property of GAME TACO and will not
    be acknowledged or returned. You agree and understand that GAME TACO is not obligated
    to use any Submission you make to the Services or GAME TACO and you have no right
    to compel such use. You hereby acknowledge and agree that your relationship with
    GAME TACO is not a confidential, fiduciary, or other special relationship, and
    that your decision to submit any material to GAME TACO does not place GAME TACO
    in a position that is any different from the position held by members of the general
    public with regard to your Submission. You understand and acknowledge that GAME
    TACO has wide access to ideas, stories, designs, and other literary materials,
    and that new ideas are constantly being submitted to it or being developed by
    GAME TACO's own employees. Many ideas or stories may be competitive with, similar
    or identical to your Submission in theme, idea, plot, format or other respects.
    You acknowledge and agree that you will not be entitled to any compensation as
    a result of GAME TACO's use of any such similar or identical material. Finally,
    you acknowledge that, with respect to any claim you may have relating to or arising
    out of a GAME TACO's actual or alleged exploitation or use of any material you
    submit to the Services and/or GAME TACO, the damage, if any, thereby caused will
    not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other
    equitable relief or to enjoin the production, distribution, exhibition or other
    exploitation of any production based on or allegedly based on the material, and
    your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right
    to recover damages, if any, in an action at law. Applicable law may restrict or
    limit the foregoing provisions of this paragraph. If so, without limitation of
    the foregoing, you agree that in no event shall GAME TACO's liability exceed $5,000.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>2.4

    TOS shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State
    of California and the United States of America, without giving effect to any choice
    of law or conflict of law principles that would result in the application of any
    other State's laws.\n\nBy using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent
    and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort,
    or otherwise) you may have against GAME TACO or the officers, directors and employees
    of GAME TACO and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals and
    entities collectively referred to herein as the \"Company Entities\") arising
    out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Services or the determination
    of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved
    exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted
    before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration
    agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and
    shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9 U.S.C. \xA7\xA7
    1-16; (3) the arbitration shall be held in San Francisco, California; (4) the
    arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these
    Terms of Service and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable
    user may have entered into in connection with the Services; (5) the arbitrator
    shall apply California law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of
    limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (6) there
    shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative
    basis, arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Company Entity's
    individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other
    persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (7) the arbitrator shall not
    have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Company Entity; (8)
    in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate
    arbitration against any Company Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or
    not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed
    this amount, GAME TACO agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf,
    subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able
    to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to
    the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees
    in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent
    the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart
    (6) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid,
    unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then
    the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be
    construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal
    or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (6) is
    found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration
    Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor GAME TACO shall be entitled
    to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS,
    visit their website at www.jamsadr.com.\n\nThe Services are controlled and operated
    by GAME TACO from its offices within the State of California, United States of
    America (\"U.S.A.\"). GAME TACO makes no representation that the Services and/or
    the Services Content, including merchandise offered for sale on the Services,
    and their copyrights, trademarks, patents, and licensing arrangements, are appropriate
    or available for use in locations other than the U.S.A. Those who choose to access
    the Services from locations outside of the U.S.A. do so on their own initiative
    and at their own risk, and are responsible for compliance with local laws. Use
    of the Services, the GAME TACO Game Sites, Apps, and the Websites is void where
    prohibited by applicable law, and void in the Prohibited Jurisdictions of the
    United States as of the \u201CUpdated\u201D date as defined above. With respect
    to shipments of merchandise to consumers, wherever they may reside, title to the
    merchandise and risk of loss shall pass to the buyer upon delivery of the merchandise
    to the common carrier.\n\nAs stated above, you acknowledge that various rules,
    regulations and laws addressing sweepstakes, contests, and tournaments with entry
    fees and/or prizes govern your participation in Tournaments (\"Gaming Laws\"),
    and that Gaming Laws are set up by each individual US state, country, territory,
    or jurisdiction. We DO NOT offer Cash Tournaments to users participating in Tournaments
    in any state in which such Competition violates its Gaming Laws (\"Prohibited
    Jurisdiction\"), and if you are located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction then you
    may not participate in Cash Tournaments. We reserve the right (but have no obligation)
    to monitor the location from which you access Services, and we may block access
    from any Prohibited Jurisdiction. Each time you log in to participate in a Cash
    Competition, you must accurately confirm the location from which you are playing.\n\nWE
    MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE LAWFULNESS
    OF YOUR PARTICIPATING IN ANY TOURNAMENT OR USE OF SERVICES, NOR SHALL ANY PERSON
    AFFILIATED, OR CLAIMING AFFILIATION, WITH US HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ANY SUCH REPRESENTATIONS
    OR WARRANTIES.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.9 - Winnings, Account Funds,
    And Payments</color></size></b>\n\nFees and payments for Services that you pay
    to us (\"Fees\") and our billing procedures are detailed in our billing application.
    If there are Fees charged to your Account, you agree to pay those Fees. All Fees
    are stated in U.S. Dollars, must be prepaid, and are non-refundable. You are fully
    responsible and liable for all charges, deposits and withdrawals made under your
    Account, including any unauthorized charges, deposits or withdrawals. We may change
    the price of Services at any time, but no price change will affect your past purchases.\n\nWe
    may change Fees and billing procedures by updating our billing application with
    or without notice to you. By providing us with a payment method, you (i) represent
    that you are authorized to use the payment method that you provided and that any
    payment information you provide is true and accurate; (ii) authorize us to charge
    you for the Services using your payment method; and (iii) authorize us to charge
    you for any paid feature of the Services that you choose to sign up for. We may
    bill you (a) in advance; (b) at the time of purchase; or (c) shortly after purchase,
    in our sole discretion. If we make an error on your bill, you must tell us within
    120 days after the error first appears on your bill. We will then promptly investigate
    the charge. If you don't tell us within that time, we'll not be liable for any
    losses resulting from the error and we won't be required to correct the error
    or provide a refund. If we identify a billing error, we will correct that error
    within 90 days. You must pay for all reasonable costs we incur to collect any
    past due amounts, including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and
    other legal fees and costs.\n\nIf you play games integrated in a Tournament without
    depositing U.S. Dollars into your Account for that Tournament, then you are a
    \"Non-Cash Player\" with respect to such Tournament. However, if you play in a
    Tournament that requires an entry paid in U.S. Dollars (\"Cash Tournament\"),
    then you are a \"Cash Player\", and if you establish a positive Account balance
    for entry fees for Cash Tournaments, then you must submit and maintain at all
    times the following current and correct information: your full name, your permanent
    residential address, your phone number, and your credit card or other payment
    information. Participating in Cash Tournaments may, in our sole discretion, require
    establishing a positive Account balance in any amount we determine. If you are
    a Cash Player, by submitting this information, you consent to allowing us to share
    your personal and payment information in confidence with third party service providers
    for the purposes of validating your identity and assessing the transaction risk
    associated with accepting your selected method of payment, and for any other purpose
    as detailed in our Privacy Policy. If you make a credit card deposit, we will
    submit an authorization request to the issuing bank of at least Ten U.S. Dollars
    (US$10.00) to your credit limit, even if the actual amount charged may be lower.
    When you withdraw funds from your account, you may be required to submit your
    social security number or other identifying information. Failure to provide your
    social security number at that time may result in our inability to process your
    withdrawal for any winnings.\n\nIf you are a Cash Player then we may, from time
    to time in our sole discretion, grant you bonus funds and/or credits (\"Bonus
    Funds\"). Bonus Funds can be used to enter Cash Competitions, but cannot be withdrawn
    or used for any other Service. All Cash Tournament entry fees will be deducted
    from your Account balance before being deducted from Bonus Funds. If you initiate
    a withdrawal of funds from your Account, you will forfeit all Bonus Funds currently
    in your Account.\n\nIf you are a Cash Player, you may request a withdrawal of
    funds from your available Account balance at any time. Digital Assets and Bonus
    Funds cannot be withdrawn. Processing of requested funds is made by check or by
    refund to the payment method used to make your deposit and may take up to ninety
    (90) days; provided, however, that we may freeze your Account and/or delay a request
    for withdrawal of funds pending completion of any investigation of reported or
    suspected Abuse, verification of eligibility, or to comply with Applicable Laws.
    We may assess a check request processing fee of up to $2.00 for any withdrawal
    of less than $10.00.\n\nIf you close your Account, we will return the funds in
    your Account subject to the TOS. If we unilaterally close or terminate your Account
    for cause as allowed in these Terms, funds in your Account may be forfeited and
    not returned to you. If your funds are forfeited by you in accordance with this
    TOS hereof, we may use these funds to defray the costs of administration and enforcement
    of these Terms, allocate or disburse such amounts to other Services, or donate
    these funds.\n\nIf your Account is inactive (i.e. you have not entered at least
    one (1) tournament) for six (6) consecutive months or more, we reserve the right
    to charge a maintenance fee of $2.00 per month (the \u201CMonthly Maintenance
    Fee\u201D). After five or more months of inactivity we will notify you by email
    that if your Account remains inactive for one more month, the Monthly Maintenance
    Fee will be deducted from your Account each consecutive month after that that
    it remains inactive. The Monthly Maintenance Fee will not be deducted from your
    Account if there are no funds in your Account. However, if your Account has no
    funds and has been inactive for twelve or more consecutive months we reserve the
    right to close your Account.\n\nUnless otherwise required by law, no refunds are
    given.\n\nIf you are eligible to receive Winnings or Prizes, we may require that
    you provide us with proof that you are, or were at the time of your participation
    in the subject Competition, eligible to participate in accordance with these Terms
    and that your participation was in accordance with these Terms. If you do not
    provide us with such proof to our reasonable satisfaction, then you will not receive
    the relevant Winnings. If you receive a payment in error, we may reverse or require
    return of the payment. You agree to cooperate with us in our efforts to do this.
    We may also reduce payment to you without notice to adjust for any previous overpayment.\n\nWhen
    you pay for any charges by credit card, you represent to us that you are the authorized
    user of such credit card. You must promptly notify us of any changes to your credit
    card account number, its expiration date and/or your billing address, or if your
    credit card expires or is canceled for any reason. We are not liable for any loss
    caused by any unauthorized use of your credit card or other method of payment
    by a third party (such as Skrill) in connection with the Services. Any attempt
    to defraud through the use of credit cards or other methods of payment, regardless
    of the outcome, or any failure by you to honor legitimate charges or requests
    for payment, will result in immediate termination of your Account, forfeiture
    of Winnings, and pursuit of civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.\n\nIf
    you are a U.S. resident, we may send you an IRS Form W-9 and 1099-MISC or other
    appropriate form if your Winnings total $600 or more in any given calendar year.
    Depending on the state in which you reside, we may also send you additional federal
    or state tax forms. Without limiting the foregoing, we may withhold from your
    existing Account balance and/or from future Winnings any amount required to be
    withheld by Applicable Laws, including amounts due in connection with your failure
    to complete relevant tax documentation, but you remain solely responsible for
    paying all federal, state and other taxes in accordance with all Applicable Laws.\n\n<b><size=40><color=#056cebff>SECTION

    CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER. THIS AFFECTS YOUR
    RIGHTS ON HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH GAME TACO. \n\n<b><size=40><color=#056cebff>SECTION
    1 - GENERAL INFORMATION</color></size></b>\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.1 -
    Terms of Service Binding</color></size></b>\n\nThese terms of service (the \"Terms
    of Service\" or \"TOS\") apply to your use of the online and mobile websites (each,
    a \"Website\") operated by Bayside Games, LLC or one of its affiliates or subsidiaries
    (collectively \"GAME TACO\"), any interactive applications (each, an \"App\")
    operated by GAME TACO and the GAME TACO \"Community Features\" (as defined herein)
    (unless a different terms of use or terms and conditions is provided on a particular
    Website, Application or Community Feature, in which case such different policy
    shall control). The Website, the Apps and the Community Features are collectively
    referred to as the \"Services.\" Your use of the Services constitutes your unconditional
    agreement to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to be bound
    by these Terms of Service, you may not access or otherwise use the Services. You
    can visit many parts of the Services without becoming a registered \"User\" (as
    defined below), but to participate in Community Features and certain other activities
    you will need to become a registered User and create an account (each, an \"Account\").
    These TOS govern everyone who uses the Services (each, \"you\" or a \"User\"),
    whether they are registered or not. Interactive games that are made available
    on the Services or are accessible from the Services are operated by Bayside Games,
    LLC or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries (collectively \"GAME TACO\").\n\nThese
    TOS, the GAME TACO Privacy Policy, and any other terms and conditions incorporated
    herein (collectively, the \"Other Policies\"), constitute the entire agreement
    between you and GAME TACO pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede
    all prior or other arrangements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
    whether oral or written. No waiver of any of the provisions of these TOS shall
    constitute a waiver of any other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor
    shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly
    provided.\n\nThe Services are intended solely for users who are eighteen (18)
    years of age and older. The Services are not available to residents of Arizona,
    Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland,
    Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. We also currently do not
    provide our services to people outside of the United States. You acknowledge that
    various rules, regulations and laws addressing sweepstakes, contests, and tournaments
    with entry fees and/or prizes govern your participation in Tournaments (\"Gaming
    Laws\"), and that Gaming Laws are set up by each individual US state, country,
    territory, or jurisdiction. Therefore, we DO NOT offer Cash Tournaments (as defined
    below) to users participating in Tournaments in any state in which such competition
    violates its Gaming Laws (\"Prohibited Jurisdiction\"), and if you are located
    in any Prohibited Jurisdiction then you may not participate in Cash Tournaments.
    In the United States, Prohibited Jurisdictions, as of the \"Updated\" date above,
    include: Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana,
    Maryland, Montana, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Tennessee. It is your responsibility
    to determine whether the state, country, territory or jurisdiction in which you
    are located is a Prohibited Jurisdiction. We reserve the right (but have no obligation)
    to monitor the location from which you access Services, and we may block access
    from any Prohibited Jurisdiction. Each time you log in to participate in a Cash
    Tournament, you must accurately confirm the location from which you are playing.\n\nIn
    addition to Gaming Laws, you are also subject to all municipal, state and federal
    laws, rules and regulations of the city, state and country in which you reside
    and from which you access and use Services, including without limitation U.S.
    export laws (together with Gaming Laws, the \"Applicable Laws\"). You are solely
    responsible for your compliance with all Applicable Laws. Access to Tournaments
    may not be legal for some or all residents of, or persons present in, certain
    jurisdictions. SERVICES AND TOURNAMENTS ARE VOID WHERE PROHIBITED OR RESTRICTED
    BY APPLICABLE LAWS. Your participation in Tournaments is at your own risk, and
    you agree not to hold us responsible or liable if Applicable Laws restrict or
    prohibit your access or participation.\n\nWe may amend, change, modify or revise
    the Terms at any time, and we may post a notice on our website at [www.baysidegames.com]
    (\"Website\") of any material changes, and you can see when these Terms were last
    revised by referring to the \"Updated\" legend above. Your continued participation
    in Tournaments and/or use of Software or Services means you accept any new or
    modified Terms. You are responsible for reviewing the Terms for any changes, so
    please check back here from time to time.\n\nYou may not modify these Terms. To
    be eligible to register an Account, to participate in any Tournament or receive
    certain Services, and/or to download certain Software, you must: (a) be a natural
    person of the United States who is at least 18 years of age or older, and who
    is personally assigned to the email address submitted during your Account registration;
    (b) have the power to enter into a contract with Game Taco; (c) be physically
    located within the U.S. when accessing your Account and participating in Tournaments;
    (d) be physically located within a U.S. state in which participation in the Tournament
    you select is unrestricted by that state's laws; and (e) at all times abide by
    these Terms. If any one of these requirements is not met at any time, we may suspend
    or close your Account with or without notice.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.2
    - License to Use</color></size></b>\n\nGAME TACO grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
    limited right and license to access, use and privately display the Services and
    the materials thereon, including the \"Services Content\" (as defined below) for
    your personal use only, provided that you comply fully with these Terms of Service.
    You may \"cache\" pages of the Services for the sole purpose of increasing the
    speed and efficiency at which you access the Services in the future. You shall
    not interfere or attempt to interfere with the operation of the Services in any
    way through any means or device including, but not limited to, spamming, hacking,
    uploading computer viruses or time bombs, or any other means expressly prohibited
    by any provision of these TOS.\n\nYou, as the holder of your Account, are solely
    responsible for complying with these Terms, and only you are entitled to all benefits
    accruing thereto. You may not allow any other person to (i) access your Account;
    (ii) access Services or Software through your Account; or (iii) accept or use
    prizes, winnings and other representative of value (including without limitation
    digital trophies, virtual currency or virtual goods) (collectively \"Winnings\").
    Neither your Account nor Winnings nor any Digital Assets are transferable to any
    other person or account. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized use
    of your password or identification or any other breach or threatened breach of
    our security or the security of your Account.\n\nYou represent and warrant to
    us that (1) you have the right, authority, and capacity to agree to these Terms,
    to register for an Account, and to participate in those Tournaments for which
    you register; and (2) you will comply with these Terms when participating in Tournaments,
    receiving Services, Apps, and/or using Software; and (3) all information you supply
    to us is complete, accurate and current (and knowingly submitting incomplete or
    inaccurate information, or failing to update and maintain current, complete and
    accurate information, may result, without limitation, in immediate termination
    of your Account and forfeiture of Winnings).\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.3
    - Changes to the Services and/or Terms of Service</color></size></b>\n\nGAME TACO
    reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify, update, add to, discontinue,
    remove or otherwise change any portion of the Services, these TOS, or the Other
    Policies, in whole or in part, at any time. When GAME TACO amends these TOS, it
    will revise the \"last updated\" date located at the top of these TOS for an amount
    of time that we determine in our discretion. For material changes to these TOS,
    GAME TACO may notify you by displaying a notice when you first use the Services
    after such changes have been made. We may also, at our discretion, provide notification
    of changes by other means. If you use the Services in any way after these TOS
    or Other Policies have been changed, you will be deemed to have unconditionally
    consented and agreed to such changes. The most current version of these TOS will
    be available on the Website and will supersede all previous versions of these
    TOS.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.4 - Changes in Services Ownership</color></size></b>\n\nAs
    set forth more fully in the Privacy Policy, you will be deemed to have consented
    to the transfer and/or disclosure to a subsequent owner of the Services of any
    personal information submitted by you and contained in GAME TACO's database if
    GAME TACO assigns your personal information to a third party as part of a corporate
    transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or sale of the Services, in whole or
    in part, of all or substantially all of GAME TACO's assets.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.5
    - Linked Websites</color></size></b>\n\nThe Services may contain links to third
    party websites or resources, which may or may not be obvious (\"Third Party Sites\")
    as well as software, text, graphics, articles, photographs, pictures, designs,
    sound, video, music, information, software applications and other content originating
    from third parties (collectively, \"Third Party Applications, Software or Content\").
    Our provision of links to Third Party Sites is not an endorsement of any information,
    product or service that is offered on or reached through such Third Party Site
    or Third Party Application, Software or Content. Such Third Party Sites and Third
    Party Applications, Software or Content are not monitored or checked for accuracy,
    appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for the content
    or performance of any Third Party Sites accessed through the Services or any Third
    Party Applications, Software or Content posted on, available through or installed
    from the Services, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability,
    privacy practices or other policies of or contained in the Third Party Sites or
    the Third Party Applications, Software or Content. If you decide to leave the
    Services and access the Third Party Sites or to use or install any Third Party
    Applications, Software or Content, you do so at your own risk and you should be
    aware that our terms and policies no longer govern.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.6
    - No Resale / Exploitation by Licensee</color></size></b>\n\nYou may not reproduce,
    copy, resell, manipulate, or exploit any part of the Services or the \"Services
    Materials\" (as defined below), for any commercial purpose.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>1.7
    - Account Termination / Prohibited Access</color></size></b>\n\nGAME TACO may,
    in its sole discretion and at any time, with or without notice, terminate your
    password, Account or use of any Community Feature, and discard and remove any
    \"Community Content\" (as defined below) posted or submitted by you to any Community
    Feature, for any reason or no reason. GAME TACO may also, in its sole discretion
    and at any time, with or without notice, discontinue any Community Feature or
    limit or restrict any User access thereto, for any reason or no reason at all.
    Should GAME TACO take any of these actions, it may, in its sole discretion, immediately
    deactivate and/or delete any or all information about and concerning your Account,
    including your \"Registration Information\" (as defined below) and submitted Community
    Content. Additionally, if your access to the Services and/or the GAME TACO Games
    Sites has been terminated or suspended by GAME TACO for any reason, you are not
    eligible to enter or participate in any GAME TACO programs or promotions (including,
    without limitation, any tournaments, sweepstakes, contests or giveaways) or to
    win any prizes. You understand and agree that GAME TACO shall not have any liability
    to you or any other person for any suspension or termination of your access to
    any Community Feature and/or the removal of information concerning your Account.\n\nIn
    accessing or participating in Services or using the Software, you represent and
    warrant to us that you will not engage in any activity that interrupts or attempts
    to interrupt the operation of the Services or Software. Anyone who engages in,
    participates in, or displays behavior that may be interpreted, in our sole discretion,

    that the content as uploaded or posted by you does not violate any person's so-called
    \"moral rights\" or other similar or analogous rights under any applicable laws
    in any country or region of the world. \n\nYou understand that the uploading to
    and/or posting of any Community Content in any Community Feature shall not be
    subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of GAME TACO, and GAME TACO
    shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Community Content. By posting

    throughout the universe, in perpetuity for any purpose whatsoever, commercial
    or otherwise, without compensation or credit to the provider, author or owner
    of the Community Content. In addition, you represent and warrant that any and
    all Community Content you upload, post, transmit, send, share, store distribute
    or otherwise make available on the Service complies with each of the foregoing
    Community Guidelines. \n\nFrom time to time, GAME TACO may offer Users the opportunity
    to create or acquire digital or virtual assets (collectively, \"Virtual Assets\").
    Such opportunities are considered Community Features, and the Community Guidelines
    shall apply to them, but such Virtual Assets also involve additional considerations.
    In particular: (1) each User acknowledges and agrees that they are granted a limited,
    non-exclusive license to use the Virtual Assets in connection with, and solely
    as a part of, their use of the Services and then only for the duration permitted
    by GAME TACO, and Users shall have no ownership or property right, title, or interest
    in or expectation of the Virtual Assets, and any use of the Virtual Assets other
    than as permitted by these TOS will constitute a violation of these TOS and may
    constitute copyright infringement; (2) any modifications, combinations, alterations
    or other changes that a User makes to any Virtual Assets (\"Alterations\") shall
    be deemed a work-made-for hire for GAME TACO and GAME TACO shall be considered
    the author and sole copyright owner of all rights and of all proceeds derived
    from the Alterations, with the right to make changes and use, in whole or in part,
    as GAME TACO may determine, together with all neighboring, rental, lending, fixation,
    reproduction, distribution and any and all other ownership and exploitation rights
    recognized in any territory, by all means, media, devices, processes and technology,
    and all rights generally known as the \"moral rights of authors\", and to the
    extent such Alterations do not constitute a work-made-for-hire, each applicable
    User hereby grants, transfers, sells and assigns all right, title and interest
    therein to GAME TACO throughout the universe in perpetuity; and (3) Virtual Assets
    have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash and may not be sold, auctioned,
    bartered, brokered, purchased outside of the Services or used to engage in any
    gambling activity. Any Virtual Assets obtained in this manner will be considered
    to have been fraudulently obtained and deemed void. For all other purposes of
    these TOS, Alterations shall be considered Community Content. \n\nYou agree to
    indemnify GAME TACO for any and all third party claims, damages, losses, and causes
    of action arising as a result of your posting or uploading any Community Content
    to any Community Feature or submitting any Community Content to GAME TACO, or
    your failure to comply with the Community Guidelines. GAME TACO does not and cannot
    review every message posted by users on the Services, and is not responsible for
    the content of these messages or the views or opinions expressed by the Users
    of the Services. GAME TACO reserves the right to, but is not obligated to, delete,
    move or edit Community Content, in whole or in part, submitted by you to the Services
    and/or GAME TACO for any reason. In no event does GAME TACO assume any obligation
    to monitor the Community Features or remove any specific material.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>3.4
    - Promotional Activities</color></size></b>\n\nBy registering for an Account,
    you agree that the Services may display your username throughout the Services,
    including, but not limited to areas such as leader boards, individual tournament
    records, message boards, chat rooms, etc. By accepting any prize from the Services,
    you agree to allow GAME TACO to print, publish, broadcast and use, and to authorize
    its affiliates and distributors to print, publish, broadcast and use, on a worldwide
    basis, in any and all media now known or hereafter devised, your name, picture,
    voice, likeness, statements, biographical information, a description of the prize(s)
    you won and any other personal characteristics for any purpose, including without
    limitation, promotional or related purposes without additional compensation, and
    you release GAME TACO from any liability with respect thereto. Please note that
    tournaments, sweepstakes, contests or promotions offered via the Services may
    be, and often are, governed by a separate set of rules that, in addition to describing
    such tournaments, sweepstakes, contest or promotion, may have eligibility requirements,
    such as certain age or geographic area restrictions, terms and conditions governing
    the use of material you submit, and disclosures about how your personal information
    may be used. It is your responsibility to read such rules to determine whether
    or not you want to and are eligible to participate, register and/or enter. By
    entering any such tournaments, sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, you agree
    to comply with and abide by such rules and the decisions of the sponsor(s), which
    shall be final and binding in all respects.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>3.5
    - Privacy Policy</color></size></b>\n\nSubmissions are governed by these TOS even
    if they include information about you or information that could be used to personally
    identify you. Any other personal information collected through the Services will
    be governed by GAME TACO's Privacy Policy located at http://www.baysidegames.com/privacy,
    which is incorporated into these TOS by reference. \n\nBy registering an account
    and providing an email address, users authorize Game Taco to provide them with
    important announcements, relevant promotions, and other related communications.
    Users will always have the opportunity to opt out of these communications at any
    time. \n\nGame Taco employees may use the Services and/or Software for the purpose
    of testing the user experience, but may not withdraw money. Game Taco directors,
    contractors, affiliates, or partners may use the Website, Services and/or Software
    without such limitation, but only if they do not have any access to non-public
    information relating to the Services and/or Software that would lead to any advantage
    in their play using the Services and/or Software.\n\n<b><size=38><color=#056cebff>3.6
    - Anti-Spam Policy</color></size></b>\n\nThe Services are vigorously against the
    practice commonly referred to as \"Spamming.\" Any User who is reported to be
    generating Spam, and whose \"Spamming\" is validated by the Services, will have
    their respective Accounts either immediately TERMINATED or SUSPENDED, at the sole
    discretion of GAME TACO. Additionally, any prizes (if any) may be voided at the
    sole discretion of GAME TACO. GAME TACO defines \"Spam\" as it is commonly understood,
    and includes the following: \n\nElectronic mail messages and commercial electronic
    messages addressed to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing
    business or personal relationship or is not sent at the request of, or with the
    express consent of, the recipient; \nMessages posted to message boards that are
    off-topic (unrelated to the topic of discussion), cross-posted to unrelated newsgroups,
    or posted in excessive volume; or \nSolicitations posted to chat rooms or sent
    to groups or individuals via Internet Relay Chat or \"Instant Messaging\" system
    (such as ICQ). GAME TACO may undertake, at its sole discretion and with or without
    prior notice, the following enforcement actions described in detail below: \n\nAccount
    Suspension: Upon the receipt of a credible and validated complaint, GAME TACO
    may elect to immediately suspend the membership of the User implicated in the
    abuse. Suspension serves as a \"final\" warning and will prevent the abuser from
    continuing his/her abusive \"Spamming\" behavior. GAME TACO will evaluate each
    validated abuse incident on a case-by-case basis and impose termination or suspension
    at its sole discretion, and may void any associated prizes. GAME TACO reserves
    the right to lift the suspension of a User at any time, at its sole discretion.
    \nAccount Termination: Upon the receipt of a credible and validated complaint,
    GAME TACO may immediately terminate the membership of the individual User implicated
    in the abuse and may void any associated winnings. \nHowever, GAME TACO makes
    no representation or warranty about any third party's compliance or non-compliance
    with United States' Anti-Spam Law."
